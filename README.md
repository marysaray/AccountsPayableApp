# Accounts Payable Application
Team Project for Advanced .NET Programming. 

    Application that will have CRUD Functionality: 

    * Create
    * Retrieve
    * Update
    * Delete
    
## Prerequisite 

- [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [Windows Forms App C# (.NET Framework)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/create-csharp-winform-visual-studio?view=vs-2019)
- [Entity Framework 6 (EF6)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/ef6/)


        
## Approaches to data-driven development

- Creating Entity Framework DbContext Class

        Steps:

        1.) Go to the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio
        2.) Rt click on the project (second item) in the solution explorer
        3.) Click on Add
        4.) Choose New Item
        5.) Left margin click on Data
        6.) Choose ADO.NET Entity Data Model
        7.) Add Entity Framework Model to the project

**This will help us manage the connection and queries that will be sent to the database.*

- Database First Approaches
    - Empty database: Design database with tools
    - Existing database: Use exisiting database
    - Not a common approach with .NET Core
- Code First
    - Track all database changes in source control
    - Empty Code First: Create C# classes and generate the database
    - Reverse Engineer: Turn exisitng database into C# classes

## Enable Code First migrations

- Create the database
    - Tools tab
    - NuGet Package Manager
    - Package Manager Console

    - Command line text: Enable-Migrations 
          
        - checks to see if database exists if not it will create it
        - only needs to run one time for each project
        
    - Command line text: update-database
        
        - when it is finished PM prompt will appear
        - unable to update: add a code-based migration

    - Command line text: Add-Migration (Initial)
        
        - creates Initial database
        - date and time stamp follow by underscore and the name given
        - file creates a class with the name given
        
    - Command line text: update-database

       - when it is finished PM prompt will appear
       - unable to update: add a code-based migration
        
**Anytime there is a change to the C# classes that will effect the database: enable code-migration*
